# UI Kit
A kit of responsive UI components that I will use <i>and wished i had used...</i> for uni projects

## Content
### Theme & style files
The theme is minimalistic, making it easy to personalize it. <br>
All CSS variables and basic classes (for flex, margins, paddings, font weights...) will be declared in a main file & every component will have its own style file.
I'm using the coolors.co contrast checker for components with their own background color and text color (e.g.  messages box).
